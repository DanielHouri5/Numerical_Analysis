# Numerical Analysis Project

This project implements various numerical methods for solving computational problems, focusing on techniques like numerical integration and root-finding. The following methods are included:

- **Trapezoidal Rule**: Approximates the integral of a function using trapezoids.
- **Simpson's Rule**: A more accurate method for numerical integration using parabolic segments.
- **Romberg Integration**: Combines the Trapezoidal Rule with Richardson extrapolation for higher accuracy.
- **Secant Method**: A root-finding algorithm that uses secant lines to approximate roots of a function.
- **Additional Methods**: The project includes several other numerical techniques that enhance the analysis and computation capabilities.

## Libraries Used
- **math**: Provides mathematical functions.
- **numpy**: Supports large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.
- **sympy**: A Python library for symbolic mathematics, used for function manipulation and integration.

This project showcases the application of numerical analysis techniques to solve real-world mathematical problems effectively.
